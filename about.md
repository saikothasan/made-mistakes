So why the title *made mistakes*? It vaguely has something to do with that whole happy accident thing, where a mistake can turn out to be something great and unplanned. But to be honest I was just looking for a short, memorable sounding domain name.

In May of 2004 I purchased mademistakes.com, and threw up a Macromedia Flash splash (hey remember those?) while I worked on building a design portfolio using Movable Type. For the next couple of years I would experiment with various content management systems ([Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) &rarr; [Textpattern](http://textpattern.com/) &rarr; [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) &rarr; [Indexhibit](http://www.indexhibit.org/)), developing minimalistic themes and learning what I could about <abbr>HTML</abbr>, <abbr>CSS</abbr>, Javascript, <abbr>PHP</abbr>, and MySQL databases.

I've since decided to go <abbr>CMS</abbr>-free and utilize black magick and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to [manage the site with static text files]({{ site.url }}/articles/going-static.html). I like knowing how things work behind the scenes so hand-coding the layouts and stylesheets is the only way to go. Not being limited by a <abbr>CMS</abbr> is a wonderful thing...

### And Who Are You Again?

Oh hey --- I'm Michael Rose, just another bearded, tattooed, time traveling, designer and illustrator working in Buffalo, New York. I'm into drawing [faceless portraits of strangers]({{ site.url }}/articles/paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project.html) on an iPad using [Paper by FiftyThree](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper), movie theater popcorn, [chicken wings done right](http://www.duffswings.com "Duff's Famous Wings"), dust collecting record collections, and over using ellipses and em-dashes.

Oh, and I'm a recent father of twin girls and will someday help redesign [my wife's blog](http://2littlerosebuds.com "2 Little Rosebuds")...
